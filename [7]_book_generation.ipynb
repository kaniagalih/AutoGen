This is Louis-Francois, co-founder and CTO of Towards AI and today, we’re diving into what might be the best Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) stack out there — thanks to a fantastic study by Wang et al., 2024. It’s a goldmine of insights for building optimal RAG systems, and I’m here to break it down for you.So, what makes a RAG system truly top-tier? The components, right? Let’s go over the best components and how they work so you can also make your RAG system top-tier and finish with a multimodality bonus.Query ClassificationLet’s start with Query Classification. Not all queries are created equal — some don’t even need retrieval because the large language model already knows the answer. For example, if you ask “Who is Messi?” the LLM’s got you covered. No retrieval needed!Wang et al. created 15 task categories, determining whether a query provided sufficient information or if retrieval was necessary.

      "1. **Access ClinVar’s Data**:\n",
      "   - ClinVar provides data in various formats including XML, TXT, and VCF. Depending on the desired detail level, consider the best format. For comprehensive data, XML is preferred.\n",
      "   - For this example, assume we access a TXT file with simplified variant data. ClinVar regularly updates its FTP site, which can be accessed programmatically.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   import requests\n",
      "\n",
      "   def download_data(url):\n",
      "       response = requests.get(url)\n",
      "       return response.text\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Parse the Data**:\n",
      "   - Utilize a parser suitable for the content type; assuming TXT for simplicity, use Python's built-in functions. If XML, `lxml` or `BeautifulSoup` would be ideal.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   import pandas as pd\n",
      "   from io import StringIO\n",
      "\n",
      "   def parse_data(raw_data):\n",
      "       data = StringIO(raw_data)\n",
      "       df = pd.read_csv(data, sep='\\t')  # Assuming TAB-separated values\n",
      "       return df\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Extract Relevant Information**:\n",
      "   - Select necessary columns and preprocess data as needed (e.g., filtering, cleaning).\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   def extract_relevant_data(df):\n",
      "       # Select columns relevant to the blog's focus, such as 'Variant ID', 'Gene Symbol', 'Clinical Significance'\n",
      "       relevant_df = df[['Variant ID', 'Gene Symbol', 'Clinical Significance']]\n",
      "       return relevant_df\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Handle Data Storage**:\n",
      "   - Save the data to a database or a file system for further analysis and usage in the blog.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   def save_data(df, path):\n",
      "       df.to_csv(path, index=False)\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Execution Example\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "url = 'https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/clinvar/tab_delimited/variant_summary.txt.gz'  # An example URL\n",
      "raw_data = download_data(url)\n",
      "parsed_data = parse_data(raw_data)\n",
      "relevant_data = extract_relevant_data(parsed_data)\n",
      "save_data(relevant_data, 'path_to_save/clinvar_data.csv')\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Next Steps\n",
      "\n",
      "- Ensure the scraper runs at regular intervals, respecting ClinVar’s update frequency to keep data fresh.\n",
      "- Implement error handling and logging to manage issues during scraping.\n",
      "- Address ethical and legal considerations, like adhering to ClinVar's data usage policies.\n",

      "### Title:\n",
      "**The Best RAG Stack to Date**\n",
      "\n",
      "### Introduction\n",
      "The article highlights the significance of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Stack in advancing AI systems, particularly by merging information retrieval and natural language generation to produce more accurate and contextually relevant responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. What is RAG?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**:\n",
      "- **Definition**: RAG is an advanced approach that augments language models with retrieval capabilities, fetching relevant documents to inform and enhance the language generation process.\n",
      "- **Application**: Primarily beneficial in open-domain question answering and dialogue systems, where richness and accuracy of information are crucial.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Components of the RAG Stack\n",
      "\n",
      "**Retriever**:\n",
      "- **Function**: Fetches relevant documents from a vast corpus based on the input query.\n",
      "- **Role**: Ensures the generated response is grounded in accurate and pertinent information.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Generator**:\n",
      "- **Function**: Uses the documents retrieved to create a coherent and contextually appropriate response.\n",
      "- **Role**: Enhances response relevance and informativeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Combiner**:\n",
      "- **Function**: Integrates the retriever and generator outputs to produce the final answer.\n",
      "- **Role**: Ensures seamless merging for coherent responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Updater**:\n",
      "- **Function**: Continuously improves retrieval and generation processes.\n",
      "- **Role**: Sustains system enhancement and adaptability to new data.\n",
