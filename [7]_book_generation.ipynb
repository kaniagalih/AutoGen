This chapter is dedicated to introducing you to Nextflow, guiding you through the installation process, and walking you through basic concepts and operations to get your first workflow up and running.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Section 1.1: Introduction to Nextflow\n",
      "\n",
      "Nextflow is a reactive workflow framework that allows the parallel and scalable execution of computational pipelines. It’s particularly well-suited for containerized and cloud computing environments, enabling fast, reproducible, and portable analyses.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Features of Nextflow:**\n",
      "- Data-driven computational pipelines\n",
      "- Portable across different execution platforms (local, cloud, HPC)\n",
      "- Supports Docker, Singularity, and Conda environments\n",
      "- Easy to write with the Groovy-based Domain Specific Language (DSL)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Section 1.2: Installing Nextflow\n",
      "\n",
      "**Prerequisites:**\n",
      "Before installing Nextflow, ensure that you have Java 8 or later installed on your system as it is required for Nextflow to run. You can check your Java version by running:\n",
      "```\n",
      "java -version\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**Installation Steps:**\n",
      "1. **Download Nextflow:**\n",
      "   - Open a terminal.\n",
      "   - Run the following command to download Nextflow into a directory of your choice:\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "     curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "   This script will download the Nextflow executable and make it runnable.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Add Nextflow to Your Path (Optional but Recommended):**\n",
      "   - Move the Nextflow executable to a directory in your PATH, for easier execution:\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "     sudo mv nextflow /usr/local/bin\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "**Verification:**\n",
      "Confirm that Nextflow is correctly installed by running:\n",
      "```\n",
      "nextflow -version\n",
      "```\n",
      "You should see the Nextflow version displayed, confirming that it is ready to use.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Section 1.3: Creating Your First Nextflow Script\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that you have Nextflow installed, let’s create a simple script to understand the basics of workflow management.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Create a New Directory and Script:**\n",
      "   - Make a new directory for your project:\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "     mkdir nf-helloworld\n",
      "     cd nf-helloworld\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "   - Create a new file named `main.nf`:\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "     touch main.nf\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Edit `main.nf`:**\n",
      "   - Open `main.nf` in a text editor and add the following lines:\n",
      "     ```groovy\n",
      "     params.str = 'Hello, world!'\n",
      "     process sayHello {\n",
      "         script:\n",
      "         \"\"\"\n",
      "         echo '${params.str}'\n",
      "         \"\"\"\n",
      "     }\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Run Your Workflow:**\n",
      "   - Back in the terminal, run your script:\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "     nextflow run main.nf\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "   - Output should be something like:\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "     N E X T F L O W  ~  version 20.xx.x\n",
      "     Launching `main.nf` [cheesy_einstein] - revision: xxxxxx\n",

      "\n",
      "### Section 1.4: Basic Nextflow Commands and Options\n",
      "\n",
      "**Commonly used Nextflow commands:**\n",
      "- **`run`**: Execute a Nextflow script.\n",
      "- **`info`**: Display system-related information.\n",
      "- **`resume`**: Resume execution from the last checkpoint.\n",
